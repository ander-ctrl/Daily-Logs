I successfully performed:
             • I TURNED THE FUCKING IPHONE INTO A GIT REMOTE; IT’S A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PORTABLE LAB
	•	SSH key troubleshooting and regeneration (identified key mismatch and corrected setup)
	•	GitHub SSH authentication testing (verified connectivity using SSH test commands)
	•	SSH agent + key loading verification (confirmed the correct key was being used)
	•	Repository access validation (confirmed GitHub access via SSH instead of HTTPS)

I demonstrated:
	•	Command-line troubleshooting workflow (isolated errors and tested step-by-step fixes)
	•	Authentication debugging (resolved “Permission denied (public key)” issues)
	•	Key management awareness (distinguished between valid, invalid, and misconfigured keys)
	•	Configuration persistence (confirmed SSH configuration behavior across sessions)

I also:
	•	Generated/imported a new SSH key (ensured correct format and placement)
	•	Updated GitHub SSH keys (removed incorrect entries and added the correct public key)
	•	Confirmed host connectivity (validated the connection to GitHub servers)
	•	Verified correct client usage (identified tool limitations and adjusted workflow)

Key takeaways:
	•	SSH failures are usually caused by wrong key loaded, wrong key uploaded, or wrong config path.
	•	GitHub authentication depends on matching the correct private key locally with the public key on GitHub.
	•	Mobile terminal environments require extra attention to file paths, permissions, and key import behavior.

Next steps:
	•	Clone the repo using SSH and confirm full push/pull workflow.
	•	Start committing daily lab progress directly from the phone environment.
	•	Begin structured lab setup for VMs and virtual networking documentation
