I successfully performed:
	•	Interface enumeration (identified active network interfaces + IP assignments)
	•	Gateway discovery (confirmed default route + router address)
	•	Network mapping (identified reachable hosts/subnet structure)
	•	Router probing (validated router response + basic service behavior)

 I demonstrated:
	•	Process monitoring (tracked running services + background activity)
	•	Resource usage analysis (checked CPU/memory usage and system load)
	•	CLI enumeration (explored key commands for system/network inspection)
	•	System health awareness (verified uptime, storage, and general stability)

I also:
	•	Created a listening service (bound to a port and confirmed it was active)
	•	Verified it with a scanner (confirmed port visibility from another device)
	•	Established a TCP connection (tested successful handshake + data flow)
	•	Observed live network communication (captured/confirmed real traffic behavior)

Key takeaways:
	•	Confirmed that scanning results match what the system reports locally.
	•	Learned how services appear differently depending on internal vs external visibility.
	•	Reinforced the difference between open ports, listening services, and active connections.

Next steps:
	•	Repeat the process using a different port and service type.
	•	Document command outputs for proof/logging.
	•	Begin controlled lab scanning using isolated VM targets.
